It's a completely functional chatting app in which you can share text as well as images just like any other chatting app out there. There is a Phone Number Authentication System which is implemented with the help of Google Firebase.
Features:
  • Texts and Images are stored locally so that they can be accessed without network
  • You can select any contact from your mobile phone's contact list and send them messages even if they haven't installed this app. they will recieve all those      messages as soon as they install the app and authenticate.
  
(i will soon migrate this app to MVVM architecture)
